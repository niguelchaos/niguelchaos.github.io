        This game project aimed to design a game to meet the requirements of the Chalmers Student Union - to create increase inclusion between students.
        To this end, this game was made to bring relative strangers together by increasing empathy between players, 
        assuming that a greater understanding between students can make students more accepting of student culture. 
        To do so, a game experience was created with mechanics that emphasized cooperation, attempting to put players in each others' shoes.

       However, players did not feel like their empathy increased after playing, since puzzles were seen as too easy, resulting in a lack of player communication.
