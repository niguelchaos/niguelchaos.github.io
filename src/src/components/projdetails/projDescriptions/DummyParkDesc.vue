          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            This project consisted of a self organizing team of 9 students working to elicit requirements, implement, test and deploy code for a visitor web app of a fictional amusement park. 
            An agile process was followed with an iterative approach to deliver a project throughout its lifecycle. 
            There were 3 sprints in total, each sprint having 2-3 weeks time frame. 
            The team members tried out different roles to have a mindset of working in Agile teams and to learn the responsibilities of multiple roles.
            There were a total of 4 roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master Deputy, UI / UX Designer, and Developer.

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Teachers act/roleplay as customers, you build the app that they want by following an Agile process. 
      We made things a bit harder for ourselves by rotating roles.

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      Many challenges happened early on, when the team was still not mature. 
      As some team members (I included) were not familiar with the responsibilities of some roles, some time was spent experimenting and learning the ropes.
      As we became more acquainted and time passed, with us refining the process through retrospectives and sprint plannings, we realised that the roles were not set in stone.
      We not only had to adapt the process to account for changes in requirements, but also different sprint lengths and human issues(sickness, work, real life stuff).
      As we also decided on role rotations, different members gradually gained different competencies. As the app became more complex, onboarding took longer as well.
