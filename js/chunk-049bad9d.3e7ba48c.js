Our team was new to AR, and much time was spent fixing technical issues resulting from that.\n    Scaling in AR was especially difficult, as the game objects looked enormous in AR. Yet, scaling the objects down reduced physics stability. \n    Rather than making the game objects smaller, the camera is actually made bigger and farther away from the content.\n    Optimizing the physics engine for the game was particularly important for our game. Each block is a rigidbody, and a single fortress has ~450 blocks.  \n    Much discussion revolved around optimizing the code architecture for easier task splitting and development, resulting in the usage of broadcasted events, singletons, and state machines.\n  ")]),i("h3",[e._v("Tools used:")]),i("ul",[i("li",[e._v("Unity3D - ARFoundation")]),i("li",[e._v("C#")]),i("li",[e._v("Version Control - Git")])])],1)},E=[],G={components:{},data(){return{media:[{url:i("bfe1"),caption:""},{url:i("4e2d"),caption:"Establishing  the general game flow helped create the states in the code."},{url:i("6df2"),caption:"The code architecture helped split work and went through several iterations."}]}},mounted(){}},F=G,U=(i("e1c8"),Object(d["a"])(F,O,E,!1,null,"227005da",null)),L=U.exports,W=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("b-container",[n("b-container",{staticClass:"description-container"},[n("b-row",[n("b-col",{attrs:{lg:"5"}},[n("h3",[e._v("Description")]),n("p",[e._v("\n          Project Goal: Learn multiplayer basics, FPS basics.\n        ")]),n("p",[e._v("\n          Originally wanting to learn the basics of how to implement a First-Person Shooter, I gradually wanted to\n          also implement a basic multiplayer system around it as well.\n          Around the same time, Unity Netcode's Beta version was out, and I wanted to learn and explore how I could\n          implement multiplayer into my game.\n          Implementing both FPS elements and Multiplayer was, perhaps, unsurprisingly difficult, as I did not\n          understand the concepts of networking in a 3D world, with animations, fast moving objects, and replication.\n        ")]),n("p",[e._v("\n          In the end, while a complete game (in that there is no win condition) was not created, I learned a great\n          deal about both FPS and multiplayer in general.\n        ")]),n("p",[e._v(" Major elements include: ")]),n("ul",[n("li",[e._v("Rigidbody FPS System")]),n("ul",[n("li",[e._v("Wall running, sprinting, and crouching.")]),n("li",[e._v("Basic weapon firing, which knocks the player back when fired.")])]),n("li",[e._v("Basic Multiplayer System")]),n("ul",[n("li",[e._v("Authentication")]),n("li",[e._v("Lobby System")]),n("li",[e._v("Server/Client Replication (RPCs, Network Managers)")])])])]),n("b-col",{attrs:{lg:"7"}},[n("b-img",{staticClass:"details-image",attrs:{center:"",src:i("93ce"),alt:"Image"}})],1)],1)],1),n("h3",[e._v("Tools used:")]),n("ul",[n("li",[e._v("Unity Netcode")]),n("li",[e._v("Version Control - Git")])])],1)},V=[],q={components:{},data(){return{media:[]}},mounted(){}},B=q,$=(i("c84b"),Object(d["a"])(B,W,V,!1,null,"459c5168",null)),J=$.exports,N=function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,n=e._self._c||t;return n("b-container",[n("b-container",{staticClass:"description-container"},[n("b-row",[n("b-col",{attrs:{lg:"5"}},[n("h3",[e._v("Description")]),n("p",[e._v("\n          My first traditional character animation ever, this student project tasked with creating a Idle, Walk, and Run animation cycle of a original character in a 2D game style. \n          As the assignment assessed the quality of character motion, I focused heavily on the the animations itself, trying to follow the 12 principles of animation.\n          The run cycle was prioritized because....I liked it more.\n          I chose a pixel art style because I had no drawing tablet.
